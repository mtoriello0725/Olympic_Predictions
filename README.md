# Olympic Predictions and Analysis
Final project for Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp. This project takes two datasets: one of all gold, silver and bronze medal winners in the Olympics, and another with all the athletes in every event. After we cleaned the datasets, we ran some experiments:

* We used calculations in Pandas to measure male athletes vs. female athletes, as well as the average age, sex and height of each. 
* Graphed the numerical results by sport, Olympic ceremony and others in Tableau.
* Tested the accuracy with a linear regression model.
* Created a predictive model to see if you could qualify for the Olympics!
